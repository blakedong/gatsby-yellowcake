  - title: "WESTERN HEALTH CARE "
    content: We believe in modern medicine and pharmaceuticals, but we also believe
      in your body’s natural desire & ability to heal. When needed, we prescribe
      pharmaceuticals & balance your system with holistic, integrative
      therapies. We respect your right to choose your healing modality & are
      happy to use western practice, herbal & homeopathic remedies, or
      integrative therapies.
  - title: "INTEGRATIVE NUTRITION "
    content: "Food is medicine. Vitamin & mineral deficiency is an epidemic in
      modern diets. Our lifestyles and modern farming practices have led to a
      host of health complications related to nutrient deficiencies from fatigue
      & insomnia to more serious chronic issues. Nutritional medicine &
      supplements are frequently added to therapies offering your body what it
      needs to feel well. "
  - title: "HERBS & HOMEOPATHY "
    content: The ancient wisdom of herbal medicine has been passed down through
      generations of healers. We harness the power of herbs to treat acute or
      chronic conditions & prescribe adaptogenic herbs to strengthen your body’s
      natural immunity. Homeopathy is based in addressing the mind-body-spirit
      connection & is an excellent therapy to add to your healing journey.
